# Serverless Vulnerability Scanner

Use AWS Lambda to regularly scan your repos for vulnerabilities

## Environment Variables

To deploy this, you will need to provide the following environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `GITHUB_ORG`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- `RESULTS_S3_BUCKET_PREFIX`

## Results S3 Bucket

A CSV file of the results of the scan will be uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket
named using this template:

    `${RESULTS_S3_BUCKET_PREFIX}-${STAGE}`

For example, if you use `RESULTS_S3_BUCKET_PREFIX=scan-results` and deploy a
production copy of this, the bucket will be named `scan-results-prod`.
